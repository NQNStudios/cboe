	<text top='22' left='50' width='413'>
		If you want other people to play your scenario, it is vitally important that you test it.
		Otherwise, lots of people might waste lots of hours playing a scenario that is unwinnable or otherwise doesn't work.
	</text>
	<text top='4' left='0' relative='pos-in pos' rel-anchor='prev' width='414'>
		To run your scenario, copy it into the Blades of Exile Scenarios folder and start it using the Start Scenario button on the game title screen.
	</text>
	<text top='4' left='0' relative='pos-in pos' rel-anchor='prev' width='414'>
		You can also quickly launch your scenario using one of the Launch options in the Scenario menu of the editor.
		In the editor preferences menu, you can set a save file to be used as your debug party.
	</text>
	<text top='4' left='0' relative='pos-in pos' rel-anchor='prev' width='414'>
		When testing your scenario, one useful feature is debug mode.
		While playing the game, type 'D'.
		This will put you in Debug Mode.
		Monsters will no longer move or attack you, and you will be able to play much faster.
		Type '?' in debug mode for a list of many other quick actions you can perform to help with testing.
	</text>
	<text top='4' left='0' relative='pos-in pos' rel-anchor='prev' width='414'>
		When you make a change in a town, before testing it, be sure to leave the town and type '>' in debug mode.
		This causes the game to forget everything you've done in that town.
		If you don't do this, your corrections may not be remembered properly.
	</text>
	<text top='4' left='0' relative='pos-in pos' rel-anchor='prev' width='414'>
		Finally, if you edit your scenario while playing in it, whenever you save a change go back to the game and reload your save file.
		Otherwise, the game may not read the scenario data properly and crash.

		Before distributing your scenario, Playtest it from start to finish, and, if possible, have friends play it too!
