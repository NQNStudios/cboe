		When you've completed your scenario, you probably want to give other people the chance to play through it.
		It's a big kick letting other people run around in your own fantasy world, get stuck at your puzzles, and kill your creations.

		The easiest way to release a scenario is to send it to NQNStudios. (nqn AT fastmail DOT com)<br/>
		<br/>
		Alternately, you can upload it as a game on itch.io, then share the link with the Blades of Exile: Itch Edition
		community and/or the Spiderweb Software message board.
