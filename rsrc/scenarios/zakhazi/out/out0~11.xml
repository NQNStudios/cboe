        <![CDATA[You reach the massive jumble of sharp rocks. Looking just under the surface of the water, you can see them all there, threatening to rip the bottom out of your boat.]]>

        <![CDATA[Fortunately, you've learned the route to pass them safely. Moving your boat carefully, you thread your way past the hazardous stones, and pass the blockage.]]>

        <![CDATA[Looking closer, you realize that this stream is a deathtrap - someone has placed sharpened stalagmites all along the river floor. Trying to pass here without knowing the safe way through would be suicide. You back away.]]>

        <![CDATA[The tunnel becomes very narrow. You don't hear or smell monsters, so you peek around inside. It was a good idea ... you realize that the walls are glittering. It's gold ore!]]>

        <![CDATA[Ugh. You've detected a rank, unpleasant smell. You look around the corner into a large cavern and see small herds of pests. They mill around the cave, grazing on mushrooms and making unpleasant bleating noises.]]>

    <string id="14">
        <![CDATA[The cave is filled with the ruinous pests of the surface world: unicorns. They're nasty critters, about four feet tall, tough and irritable, and with a nasty, sharp horn. The Empire must have teleported a bunch of them down here, knowingly or not.]]>

        <![CDATA[You sail out onto a large, subterranean lake. The green fungus light is unusually bright here, revealing large schools of pale cave fish swimming under the surface. Some of them boldly move close to look at you with eyes on tentacles, and swim away again.]]>

        <![CDATA[Looking around, you see the light of small fires to the northwest. Peering intently through the mist, you see a large island with a huge stone spire on it. Lights have been lit in windows in the spire. Someone must be living there!]]>
